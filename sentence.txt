Is it certain that the SPD will lead the next government?

Nothing is certain and it all depends on how the coalition talks go. What we know is that Scholz and his SPD have the momentum at the moment to form the government so the ball is in their court in some ways. The main question right now is whether they can make it work with the Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) as partners.

A fresh survey shows the majority of Germans would like to see this three way government, and Scholz as chancellor.

In the poll conducted by infratest dimap for ARD, 62 percent of respondents said they favoured SPD candidate Scholz as chancellor, while 16 percent went for Union candidate Laschet. A majority of 55 percent said they would prefer to see a so-called traffic light – ‘Ampel’ – coalition – that’s the SPD-led government with the Greens and the FDP. 

In the survey, 33 percent said they wanted a so-called ‘Jamaica’ coalition of the CDU/CSU, the Greens and the FDP.

In another poll, 56 percent said they wanted Scholz as chancellor and 11 percent chose Laschet.
